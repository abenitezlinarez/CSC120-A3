TA hours: 9/21 7-9pm; 9/24 7-9pm; 9/25 7-9pm
Resources: Oracle, StackOverflow, and pretty much every tutor that worked this week

Overview/personal: This assignment was okay. I think I'm getting into a good system with attending office hours regularly even if I don't have a question. I made consistent progress throughout the week so I wasn't panicking on the day it was due. I will admit the premise of this project scared me a little because I didn't know functions like .contains, .replace/.replaceAll existed but after some research on Oracle, StackOverflow, and attending TA hours I think I have a good graspe on them. I think I also surprised myself because I was able to solve a lot of problems that came up with lists and for loops which use to scare me a lot in the past. I know my code isn't the most efficient code but since I got it to work like that I didn't want to mess it up by trying to make it more efficient even though I know a list would've probably done the job, maybe next time :D

Classmates/ TA Hours: I attended TA hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday at Ford on the third floor from 7-9pm and the tutors were all so helpful! I understood most of the tasks that I needed to complete but their support really helped me actually finish the project so I really appreciate them! I did talk to some classmates during class about the project but I was to nervous to actually reach out to them after class, I specifically spoke to Michelle (in my class) a good amount about the project but not for help neccessairly but rather to see what she tried and how her project was going.

What are your initial impressions of Java: I think Java is fairly similar to python except for the obvious OOP properties. A lot of functions transfer over and overall it hasn't been a horrible experience. I also know C++ (specifcially for Arduino) so a lot of the syntax carries over so it isn't out of this world for me. Overall I have so far enjoyed coding in Java and getting to learn a new language!

Draw any conclusion about programming between the two languages: Python and Java, like I said above, are fairly similar except for one being more Object-oriented. The syntax is really different but the overall functions and ideas are the same. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future: I think for the most part I didn't run in to too many errors except for special cases of some functions. For example replaceAll, when working with periods, actually replaces everything into whatever the replacement is. So when I tested a period to see if it would become a question mark it actually made everything a question mark. Luckily Binah in tutoring was able to help me and show me that it was a special case of replaceAll. I also didn't know a scanner had to be moved down after it scanned something so I had two scanners initially for everything that was being scanned and Chris from TA hours helped me find the specific fucntion for moving the scanner down. ALSO! BE MINDFUL OF ALL THE METHODS YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT. I had finished the project but then I realized I never touched the respond feature so I had to frantically edit all my code to make it fit in the conventions of respond and I was panicking and it was no fun.
